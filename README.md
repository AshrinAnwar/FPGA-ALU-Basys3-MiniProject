# 4-bit and 8-bit ALU using Basys 3 FPGA

This project demonstrates the design, simulation, and implementation of 4-bit and 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) using Verilog HDL. The designs were synthesized and tested on the Basys 3 FPGA development board.

## 🚀 Features
- Arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction
- Logical operations: AND, OR, XOR, NOT
- Real-time input/output via switches and LEDs

## 🔧 Tools Used
